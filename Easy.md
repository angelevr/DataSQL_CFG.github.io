Table: World

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | int     |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

#### Solution
SELECT
    name,
    population,
    area
FROM
    world
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 250000000

Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

#### Solution
SELECT
    product_id
FROM
    Products
WHERE low_fats = "Y" AND recyclable = "Y"

Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

#### Solution
SELECT
    name
FROM
    Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

#### Solution
SELECT
    name
AS
    Customers
FROM
    Customers
LEFT JOIN
    Orders
ON
    Customers.id = Orders.customerId
WHERE
    Orders.id IS NULL

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

#### Solution
delete p2  -- we are deleting p2, cause p1 table match with 1,john and p2 match with 3,john
           -- hence, we need to delete higher id, according to question
from person as p1
inner join person as p2
where p1.id < p2.id and p1.email = p2.email

Table: Salary

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

#### Solution
UPDATE Salary
SET sex =
CASE
WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
END

Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

#### Solution
SELECT
    employee_id,
IF
    (employee_id % 2!=0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%', salary, 0) AS bonus
FROM
    Employees
ORDER BY  
    employee_id
